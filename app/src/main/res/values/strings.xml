Priority B is the default option and guarantees delivery within the next three business days. Larger packages can be posted as priority A. These will be shipped as quickly as possible and usually arrive the next business day after the package is dropped off. It should be noted that the transit times differ depending on the destination.

    <string name="questionsanswers_realtime_package_location_question">Can I know where my package is in real time?</string>
    <string name="questionsanswers_realtime_package_location_answer">Yes. We have set up a parcel tracking service that allows you to follow your parcel in real time throughout its delivery. You can find this service on the customer home page of the application. All you need to do is enter the shipment number of the package that was sent to you when registering your package to view the routing information. Parcel tracking is only available on the national territory.</string>
