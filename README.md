## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**There are two branches : `main` and `firebase-implementation`. Which one do I have to choose if I just want to test the app ?!**

ðŸ‘‰ The only difference between the two branches is the database implementation :
- `main` contains the application that runs with the **Room local database** provided by Android.<br>If you choose this option, the application will store the data **locally** inside your device.

- `firebase-implementation` contains the application that runs with the **Firebase cloud database**, provided by Google.<br>If you choose this option, the application will store the data **remotely** inside the firebase cloud.

ðŸ’¡ We recommend to use the version of the application that is on the `main` branch because you will not have any problem that could arise with the Firebase database _(database no longer maintained, you are not connected to internet, etc)_ and in bonus you can inspect the data stored by the application thanks to the _Database Inspector_ tab of Android Studio. 

### Installing

You will need to follow the steps below in order to run the application :

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Download the project files in ZIP format to your computer.
3. Unzip the downloaded file.
4. Open the project folder _(the unzipped folder)_ in Android Studio.
5. Run the android application with Android Studio.

Once these four steps have been executed, you will be able to use the **Shipment-Tracking** application and to experience the life of a postman!
